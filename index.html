						The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
						California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
						vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer.
						The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
						drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive
						experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
						confident the band could succeed even further with more support,
						pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.
					</p>
					<p class="bio-section__paragraphsecond">
						From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition
						and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately
						fell in love with the band’s original and organic attitude,
						solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and
						coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves
						as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic
						performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their
						second studio album, looking to be released in early 2024.
